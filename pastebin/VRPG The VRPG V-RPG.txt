PLOT
An ancient evil awakens. A prophecy says only an older brother and his imouto can defeat him, and so our protagonists, Wes and Jay, set off to defeat the evil. Joined by boardtans, Our heroes travel through the world, gathering power and friends to defeat the ancient evil. The evil is confronted and is revealed to be Todd Howard, who wishes to turn all of reality in a port of Skyrim. Protags defeats him, and the world is saved. 
(Maybe) Because you cannot climb mountains in DQ1, and Skyrim is incredibly mountainous, this would result in the end of the world as everyone would starve to death. 
 
 
Don't forget:
? The game will be silly, but have serious moments that cover loneliness, depression, lack of motivation and other topics.
 (This not difficult to implement in the least)
? I hate furries with a passion beyond all human comprehension.
? Chekov's gun
 
REMEMBER!
***NOTHING IS SET IN STONE***
Don't like something? Tell me!
I'm writing for you, not me.
 
 
 
 
This is not meant to be a carbon copy of DQ1.

-Plot point
	/Explanation
 
 
 
 
The plot follows the 12 stages of the Hero's journey.
This is a very popular method of storytelling, and can be observed in a lot of media, most notably for us, The Dragon's Quest games.
 
If you're unfamiliar, the 12 stages are:
1 The Ordinary World (The Locker Room)
2 Call To Adventure (Hey Buddy I think you got the wrong door)
3 Refusal of the Call (Fuck you)
4 Meeting the Mentor 
5 Crossing the Threshold (Ah, Fuck you Leatherman)
6 Tests, Allies, and Enemies (Maybe you and I should settle it right here on the ring if you're so tough)
7 Approach the Innermost Cave 
8 The Supreme Ordeal (I'll show you who's the boss of this Gym)
9 The Reward, Seizing the Sword
10 The Road Back
11 Death, and then Resurrection (When all hope seems lost, triumph) 
12 Return with the Trophy
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1 The Ordinary World (The Locker Room)
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
-The home of Wes and Jay, they live with Moe and Hoe. 
-Jay is using Wes' PC without his knowledge. 
-Hoe is not currently present. 
	/Setting
 
-Moe is engrossed in an MMO.
	/In character behavior. Establishes she's not focused on what's currently going on around her.
 
-Wes is practicing clipping through walls with a wooden plate. 
	/In character behavior. Establishes he's not paying attention to Jay at this time.
 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
2 Call To Adventure (Hey Buddy I think you got the wrong door)
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
-Jay break's Wes' computer while attempting to buy enchanted body pillows on tor using Dogecoin.
	/It's a silly call to adventure. Wes and Jay are silly characters.
 
They're forced to go in search of /g/ to repair Wes' PC. 
A messenger tells them the King wants to speak with them. 
Wes and Jay are told by the king they are the only ones who can defeat the Ancient Evil. 
Jay mentions to Wes he shouldn't get sidetracked on sidequests but he tells her "It's the Journey, not the destination".
 
They arrive in the castle, the King tells them the prophecy. 
Wes immediately asks what the reward is.
King and Jay are caught off guard, because if Jay and Wes don't do this, everyone dies, including them.
King tells them "The entire kingdom will revere them as heroes" or some shit like that. 
Jay is ecstatic
 
 
 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
3 Refusal of the call (Fuck you)
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Wes:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9iqsQ283kQ
King is troubled. Jay is at a loss for words. 
Wes does multiple barter checks. This doesn't need to be programmed in to have the option of doing a barter check. Just have it as
[Barter 50] etc etc etc, [Barter 75] etc etc etc,  [Barter 100] etc etc etc. 
King offers Wes and Jay something substantial. Access to the entire Kingdom's Armoury.
King also gives them /adv/, the fairy in a jar (like Navi, get it?) that gives them useless advice.
 
Wes accepts, but decides to ignore the quest regardless.
Wes and Jay leave, they make their way back home to get their equipment before going on the quest.
 
 
Maybe it's revealed later that king is actually a much older /qst/?
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
4 Meeting the Mentor
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
-The town advises you and gives you items to prepare you for your journey outside, including [Shopkeeper] who runs the general store. [Shopkeeper] will likely act as the mentor here. Advises Wes and Jay. Tells them it's dangerous to be alone these days, stick together.
	/ Gives some character to the town, introduce the importance of talking to secondary NPCs with items, tips, and a meme or two.
	Foreshadowing. Moe is alone, not paying attention to what's outside, and they've just been told it's dangerous to be alone.
 
-Todd (name should be changed to sustain mystery) is a local shopkeeper, maybe has a smith of some kind. A member of the community.
	/ Seeing antagonist early facilitates him changing over time and creates context for future meetings.
 
-Todd should be present when Wes and Jay arrive, but gone when they finish speaking with the King. Anyone who Wes and Jay ask about this will say he departed separately from the village to pursue the ancient evil. Generic comments about how he's got a good heart. 
	/ Regardless of what he's said to people, he does not have an alibi for the destruction of Wes and Jay's home. 
 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
5 Crossing the Threshold (Ah, Fuck you Leatherman)
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
-Wes and Jay return to find their house has been destroyed in their absence, and someone running in the other direction.
	/Bit of a trope, protags leave their home and it's destroyed, but it's a good way of progressing the story, so I've used it.
 
-All that is revealed is the silhouette of /v/. 
	/The only time /v/ is seen before his fight. It is not apparent Todd is controlling him until the party actually fights him.
 
-The home has collapsed, destroying most of their things, and killing Moe. 
	/This makes things personal for Wes and Jay.
 	"No one kills my Moe"
 
-Some of their more valuable items are also missing entirely. 
	/Foreshadowing, for when Todd fights them kitted out in this gear. It removes and doubt he was behind this, without 					 
  	explicitly stating it.
 
They search the ruins of their home for anything useful that hasn't been destroyed, and Jay finds a Necromancy potion belonging to Moe.
Jay pours it on Moe's body, and she comes back, but only as a skeleton! Origin story! 
 
Note from anon: The potion should be like a really on the nose chekov's gun thing. Like moe says "I love you both. And my necromancy potion of unlife, I love it too" or something
 
-*Achievement unlocked* [Ain't that a kick in the head]
	/References are fun. Recommend any classic achievements you want to see in the game to me, I'll see if I can work them in.
 
 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
6 Tests, Allies, and Enemies (Maybe you and I should settle it right here on the ring if you're so tough)
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
-The first goal is a village to the east, the next destination on the way towards the ancient evil.
	/ Getting an adventure started.
 
-On the way East, the duo find the bridge destroyed. With the ancient evil awakened, a faction seemingly prepared has emerged to burn the bridge. 
	/ First leveling section. Builds mystery.
 
-Todd has made it to the bridge first with a wagon of his goods. /tg/ is there, chatting with [Unspecified Individual] about military tactics. It is mentioned to the party that they may be able to find help in the east to cross the bridge.
	/ Spot to buy items.
 
-Arriving at the town in the NE, a [Recurring Antagonist 1] is caught in the grip of the first boss, [Unspecified Monster 1]. [Unspecified Monster 1] spots Party, changes focus. [Unspecified Monster 1] Dialogue here. Boss fight begins.
	/ First boss.
 
-Upon victory, [Recurring Antagonist 1] thanks you for saving him. [Recurring Antagonist 1] calls in a favour and tells the Party that they'll be able to cross the bridge now. 
	/ Progression.
 
-Should the heroes enter the village, it's full of happy Scavenfolk, who've been gradually moving to the surface. Pre Timeskip Rat Hitler is here, though he's just a happy painter. They can restock here.
  	/Worldbuilding. 
 
-Back at the bridge, a group of large workers on the payroll of [Recurring Antagonist 1] have formed. [Recurring Antagonist 1] is not there. The workers are strong and hate working for [Recurring Antagonist 1]. The bridge for Todd will take days, but for the party an especially large lumberjack fells a large tree and secures it to cross the river. 
	/ Enter new area of the continent. Additional party member can join here. Opportunity to introduce /diy/, Side characters work 
 	to build world- Always someone stronger than the protagonists, and in this scenario it's just some lumberjack/diy.
 
-The Eastern Village is not in the slightest concerned about the ancient evil. To the citizens, the issue is nonexistant. A Bishops Guild is in this town, where the party might discover their financial purpose, a guild of connections that benefit every trader. 
	/ Interesting development, subverts plot. Introduces a worldly faction. Builds world- this isn't just a bunch of random people 
  	in random places, this is an interconnected Kingdom. Good opportunity for character personality to come through, as of now 
  	they've encountered two people who are stronger + an opportunity to be lazy and leave the ancient evil to the hero.
 
-The party asks around to see if they can help at all. A very frail looking leader of the village, [Recurring Antagonist 2 / FLATLUS], well tied into the Bishop's Guild, scoffs and tells them there's been some people going missing on the mountain, they should make themselves useful and investigate. Make it abundantly clear that [Recurring Antagonist 2] doesn't care if they die. 
	/ Chance for character personality. Second leveling section. New environment to match new town. Chance to introduce a new party 
  	member at the base of the mountain who joins the climb. 
 
-Before reaching the peak, boss climbs up from the side of the mountain shrouded in cloud before leaping at the party.
	/ Second boss. Maybe builds mystery, a bit of a stretch in this context. 
 
-After the boss, the party looks beyond to see something in the distance symbolizing the ancient evil (fountain of odd light, etc.). The land, way out there, is slowly but surely changing in pallet. The color is growing from the source.
	/ Keep in touch with goal. Good moment for character's thoughts on the hero and ancient evil.
 
-With the view from the mountain, the heroes spot a fire in the next city over. Thunder? 
	/ New goal. Chekov's gun. The city they just visited is now on fire. Rat Hitler was the sole survivor, because he was able to 	 	 
  	escape to the sewers. 
 
-Descending down below, Todd can be seen being chased by humanoid figures. The gang intercept. 
	/ New type of enemy. Keep in touch with Todd. Foreshadowing for later confrontation.
 
-Behind Todd's escape lie several other humanoid figures, slain by Todd unbeknownst to the party.
	/ Favorite anime trope. Todd is powerful, but the characters won't know that until it's too late.
 
-Todd had to abandon the majority of his goods. He decides to go to the Eastern Village to interact with the Bishop Guild.
	/ Stock up before moving towards new goal.
 
-The party head towards the burning village.
	/ Third leveling section.
 
 
-The party arrives inside the burning village. In the center, surrounded by flames and ash, is a powerful minion of the ancient evil. 
he's got fire based abilities. Dialogue with Heroes follows. It'll be sick edgy stuff about fire and purification, killing rats, the symbol of pestilence, you'll love it I promise. 
	/Second boss fight. Demonstrates the ancient evil is actively harming the world. It's not just vague talk, there are people 	 
 	being brutally killed by the envoys of this entity.
 
-Following totally sick bants, Wes and Jay defeat the minion.
	/Progression. They're fighting and defeating more powerful enemies. 
 
-Upon defeating the minion, Pre-timeskip Rat Hitler appears. He's burned and visibly distraught, but he thanks Wes and Jay for killing the minion, and tells them the direction from whence he came. He tells the heroes he's never going to the surface again, but if they ever need help, he will never forget what they have done for him.
	/Wes and Jay have a positive pre-timeskip relationship with Rat Hitler. The fact that they saved his life makes it logical for 
  	him to sacrifice himself for them later.
 
-The Heroes venture in the direction given to them by Rat Hitler. Along the way, they encounter Todd, and his caravan once more. 
Todd warns the heroes about danger ahead. Urges them not to go forward. 
   	/Fourth leveling section. It's very clear that Todd doesn't want the heroes to go ahead. He says it's for their safety, but in 
     	reality, there's a dungeon up ahead he doesn't want to heroes to enter.
 
-The heroes continue on. They arrive at a ruins, with an entrance that leads underground. [Recurring Antagonist 1] is there, with a small group of men rigging explosives. [Recurring Antagonist 1] Tells Wes and Jay that this ruin is packed to the brim of Minions serving the ancient evil. They've stolen a great deal of gold from the Bishop's guild, and even kidnapped people, but because of the danger inside, the King's asked them to seal the entrance with explosives. 
     	/Appearance of an antagonist again. Demonstrates how powerful the minions of evil really are. Even though they possess a great 
      	deal of the Kingdom's treasure, it's impossible to kill them.
 
-[Recurring Antagonist 1] tells Wes and Jay that if they're able to clear out the creatures inside, and save the innocents, the gold is theirs. Wes and Jay agree. They venture inside of the dungeon.
       	/Reason to risk their lives, they're both noble and rewarded for fighting these monsters.
 
-First Dungeon.
       /What's an rpg without a dungeon?
 
-Upon reaching the deepest layer, they find the gold, but do not see the missing people. They do encounter a locked door. Wes can clip through it using his wooden plate. If he does, he will encounter a room of bloodstained walls, with bones strewn about, bits of flesh on the floor. The monsters had eaten them. Wes is shaken. He clips back to the other room. Jay asks Wes if he saw the innocents. Wes simply replies that they're gone.
        /Grimdark.
 
-The Heroes return to the entrance. One of the men with [Recurring Antagonist 1] tells them to stop where they are, and points a weapon at them. [Recurring Antagonist 1] asks them if they've killed all the creatures inside the cave. They have. He asks what happened to the innocents. Wes says that they're gone. [Recurring Antagonist 1] tells his man to blow the entrance. Explosion knocks Wes and Jay back into the cave, and seals them inside. Vaguely from the outside, they hear him laugh, and tell them not to worry. He'll be back in a few months to dig out the gold.
          /Having used them, [Recurring Antagonist 1] reveals his true nature and tries to kill them. Dick move, especially considering 
            they saved his life, but this says a lot about his character. He uses people, and discards them when they're no longer 
           valuable to him.
 
-Jay is scared, Wes remains cool. Starts inspecting walls, hitting things with his swords, trying to figure a way out. This goes on for a while. They decide to rest, and conserve their energy. After some time, as they begin drifting off to sleep, they hear a scratching noise. It begins to get louder. 
           /buildup.
 
-An unnamed Scaven breaks through the dungeon wall. He tells Wes and Jay he heard them, and recognized their voices as those who kileld the Scavenslayer. He leads them through his tunnel, and they emerge into the Sewer. 
             /It's not just Rat Hitler who remembers them, Wes and Jay have a positive reputation with many Scavenfolk for what they 
             did.
 
-Unnamed Scaven bids them adieu, but he warns them that the Scaven have felt a terrible omen. They warn Wes and Jay that evil grows stronger, and the Scaven can only do so much to help them.

7 Approach the Innermost Cave
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Leading up to facing Todd the first time.
 
The innermost cave is a bit like World 8 in super mario bros, you dig?
It's the build up to fighting the bbeg. 
 
I figured a good way to implement a serious tone is to have the antagonists represent some of the topics wished to address.
 
 -On the way to Todd, they encounter [Recurring Antagonist 1]. He has a powerful minion at his side, but is powerful on his own.
	/I'm thinking of a way to make this guy represent loneliness, and lacking people who understand the way one thinks. 	 	 
 	Although he's surrounded by minions who will do his every request, none of them particularily like him, and he has no one with 
  	whom he can talk to. Sounds a bit simple now but I'm working on it.
 
 
-On the way to Todd, they encounter [Recurring Antagonist 2]. He's alone. [Recurring Antagonist 2] has been established to be a very weak, frail individual, but does something to themselves and suddenly becomes incredibly powerful. Perhaps he drinks a cursed potion. Makes a contract with a demon. Something of this nature.
	/I want to make him represent failure, Self Hatred, and people's challenges in accepting what they cannot change.  His 
  	weakness disgusted him, and so he horrendously damaged himself in order to achieve strength because he was not able to accept 
  	the hand that had been dealt to him. If it sounds like shit, I'm still working on it. 
 
-Upon arriving at Todd, they encounter [Recurring Antagonist 3] At Todd's side. Todd's confident that with [Recurring Antagonist 3] at his side, he can defeat you. Upon getting hit the first time, [Recurring Antagonist 3] will flee from the fight, abandoning Todd. Need to tie up that loose end though.
	/This gentleman will represent suicide. Suicide's like ragequitting when you're losing. You don't face the loss, but your team 		 
 	mates do. By having [Recurring Antagonist 3] abandon Todd, I'm trying to convey that everyone has someone who depends on them, 
  	no matter who they are. Todd's victory was certain with his ally, but the loss of his ally has left him troubled and uncertain.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
8 The Supreme Ordeal (I'll show you who's the boss of this Gym)
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The Heroes fight Todd, and triumph over him.
 
Todd will be geared up, Hammer of Song in hand, etc, but he'll still look like a normal human being, for the most part. 
Todd's Gear is partially composed of the items that were missing from the home of Wes, Jay, Moe, and Hoe. 
 
 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
9 The Reward, Seizing the Sword
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
They regain the Hammer of Song.
People rejoice, the world has been saved.
Wes and Jay are heroes.
The King gives them their rewards. 
 
It could be a seemingly useless item that does nothing right until the very end which Wes uses to do the console gag everyone has been asking for.
 
You could have a scene where the king offers like his entire treasury, full of legendary items making Jay salivate, but then Wes just picks up one weird cylinder-item that just says "MO"
 
Then, once Todd Howard becomes Godd Howard, he drops one of his D's, which the party obtains as an Item as Todd becomes God Howard.
 
Wes later uses that dropped D on the incomplete item, forming MOD, cuing into a scene like
>What will you, players be, without us devs!? Bow down to us and become Skyrim!
>We players do not need devs! We never needed them! No, we will become devs yourselves!
>Wes uses MOD
 
 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
10 The Road Back
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The Heroes go to a cemetery to mourn those that they lost over their adventure. 
 
They see /v/, for the first time in the game 
/v/ is undead
/v/ has Todd's severed head, and is digging up m00t's grave
/v/ throws the head into moots grave, then https://youtu.be/X4monaBsyfg?t=182
 
 
 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
11 Death, and then Resurrection (Things become incredibly bleak. Nevertheless, in the end, the heroes triumph.)
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Todd absorbs m00t
Todd gains absolute power
At some point during Todd's revival, the Hammer of Song taken back by /v/ or Todd or whoever is allied with them.
 
[Todd freezes the party in time. He's afraid they'll just immediately kill him again] 
During this period, Todd ports too many ero mods into reality, creating the coomlands???
 
 
Heroes need to kill the Coomer to gain access to the coomlands
Literal hell
Only people happy are the nsfw board tans
COOMLANDS?????
The Coomer is the guardian of the coomlands. In order to enter, you must defeat him first. Upon entering, you can then interact with the nsfw tans and see what has happened to the world. 
 
 
They make it through
Kill more enemies
Fight /v/, defeat /v/
(I want to include something about /v/ infecting /a/ and taking control of it, due to the relationship the boards have)
When /v/ weakens, /a/ is able to free itself from /v/'s control)
 
/v/ will be right about to kill Wes, Jay, and friends,
But then
/a/ sacrifices itself to kill /v/ 
It'll be like super sad you'll cri ;-;
 
 
True final boss fight
Godd Howard
 
Wes and Jay defeat him by adding so many mods Skyrim Crashes?
Like ah, water. You need water to survive, but you can still drown in it. 
They drown him in his own bugs and glitches. 
 
"What brought life into his games now takes it from him"?
 
 
I want Moe to make a Hunt down the freeman reference for shits and giggles, because it's thanks to Todd she's a Skeleton.
"You fucked up my face"

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
12 Return with the Trophy
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
They get the Hammer of song, and need to bring it to somewhere. 
Maybe they could give it to /k/, because he's the only one they can trust with this weapon?
/k/ lives innawoods, inside a shack, that surrounded with elaborate traps.
Shack leads down to a bunker. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Note to self: Would be really fucking stupid to focus too much on the epilogue before you write the story.
 
Epilogue?????????????????
Wes and Jay find /g/-tan's cave/basement/home.
He's in the dark illuminated by only the glow of a monitor. 
He's sitting at a desk, facing away from Wes and Jay.
Wes says something about his computer being busted. 
/g/ just repeats install Gentoo every time you try to talk to him. 
Eventually Wes and Jay leave. 
 
 
 
Edited version.
 
King:
Scions of the bloodline of /vr/, hero of legend!
Long have I awaited thy coming! 
In days of yore, thy revered ancestor did receive of the Almighty m00t the Hammer of Song. 
By its power was our world cleansed of the cancer which did beset it.
Yet, alas, some few years past, there did arise a new threat--the Unending Evil. 
With his awakening, he did steal away the Hammer of Song from us, plunging the land into darkness once more. 
Should this state of affairs allowed to continue, the cancer will surely take unrelenting hold, and our realm perish. 
The Prophecy foretold of a Brother and Sister, bearing the blood of /vr/, who together alone could banish this evil. 
So I say to thee, of the bloodline of heroes, vanquish this Ancient Evil, and reclaim the Hammer of Song!"
 
 
 
 
I called Todd the Unending Evil because of the unending Skyrim re-releases.
The Hammer of Song is just a placeholder. My thoughts were Song => Music => Bands => The B& Hammer. The B& Hammer has the ability to alter reality, but can only be used effectively by one who understands it, that being m00t. Someone who doesn't understand the Hammer can do simple things, but they don't have the power m00t possessed. The idea here was that in the absence of m00t, cancer/darkness has spread, and only The B& Hammer, which has been lost to Todd, can undo this. Todd wishes to unlock the power of the B& Hammer in order to gain to change reality into a port of Skyrim?
 
 
 
 
 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
currently re organizing the misc ideas section.
 
Alternate ending where Fatlus kills Wes and takes his armour to flirt with Jay.
Jay actually ends up happier in this ending than the true ending.
